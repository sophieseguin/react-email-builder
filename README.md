# React email builder
Work in progress.
React app which allows the user to build an email template using predefined modules.

## Set up
```npm install```

## Build

To begin working on the project, run:

```gulp serve```

A new tab will open on your browser. Styles and scripts will be processed and watched for changes.

## Usage
Click modules from the list on the left to the email template on the right.

## List of improvements to be done
* Data for the modules coming from a JSON file
* Delete modules once in the template
* Saving functionality (add the Doctype and relevant markup to the top and end of the email)
* Drag & drop modules in the template
* Reorder modules in the template
* Being able to edit modules containing text
